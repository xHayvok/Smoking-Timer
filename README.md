# Smoking-Timer
A simple repeating timer themed around hitting the pennifer. Primarily built because I smoke alone and often forget to hit the pennifer until I'm not high anymore, but also because it was a fun project.

# Usage:
Pretty straight forward I think. 2 buttons in the upper-righthand corner for setting hit count and timer length. Click the green triangle under the timer to start it. Click the red square to pause it, click it again to reset the time and hit counter. When the sound plays its time to take a hit. On the last hit the screen will also read "Game Over". By default its set to 3 hits at 1 minute seperation, arbitrary numbers just to have something in there. Play around with it and find numbers that you like :)
